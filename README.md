This repository contains personal Java-based game projects aimed at practicing and reinforcing programming concepts through game development.

## Games Included

**Pong**  
Classic two-player Pong game.

**Snake**  
A remake of the classic Nokia snake game.

**Tic-Tac-Toe (Ta te ti)**  
Traditional two-player grid-based game.

**Que no te coman**  
Original game idea. The player must reach the green square 20 times without colliding with red squares:
- Green square has the same speed as the player.
- Red squares start at equal speed but increase it every 5 points.
- The player starts with 3 lives and gains extra lives every 5 points.

## Purpose

To consolidate object-oriented programming, game logic, and user interaction skills in Java through hands-on development of simple and custom games.
